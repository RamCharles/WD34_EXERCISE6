			<p class="contentheader">History of zamboanga city</p>
			<p>The Subanon (Subanen) people first arrived in the region in the 12th century, beginning Zamboanga City's long history as a settlement. From Basilan and the Sulu archipelago, numerous Tausug, Yakan, Sama-Banguingui, and Sama-Bajau people migrated here over the ensuing centuries. Islam rose to prominence after it arrived. Zamboanga was chosen by the Spaniards as a military stronghold in Mindanao when they started colonizing the Philippines, opening the way for Christian settlers. Later, Fort Pilar was built to protect the town. Due to its lengthy history, Zamboanga has a diverse and complex population. As a result of its proximity to Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia, a variety of influences can also permeate the region. Nearly all facets of its culture, including its languages, religions, and cuisines, demonstrate this diversity. Currently, Zamboanga City is a chartered city that is heavily urbanized. Despite being grouped with Zamboanga del Sur for statistical purposes, it is politically independent. In addition, it serves as the center of the area's economy, education, and culture.</p>
			<p class="contentheader">REQUIREMENTS FOR TRAVEL TO ZAMBOANGA CITY</p>
			<p>At the time of writing, Zamboanga City is under ALERT LEVEL 1. Here are the requirements for leisure travelers from similar Alert Levels or lower: </p>
			<p class="listitem">FOR COMPLETELY IMMUNIZED</p>
			<ul class="listcontent">
				<li><span class="listcontentspan"> A valid government ID.</span></li>

			<p class="contentheader"> TRAVELLING INTO ZAMBOANGA CITY</p>
			<p><b class="travelcontent">By Plane:</b></p>
			<p>Zamboanga International Airport (ZAM), which also serves as the gateway to Basilan, serves Zamboanga City and surrounding municipalities. Because there are no direct flights from Luzon or the Visayas to Bongao, most Tawi-tawi visitors must also make a stopover at Zamboanga Airport. Most domestic airlines fly to Zamboanga from Manila. However, if you're looking for low-cost flights, both AirAsia and Cebu Pacific fly daily to Zamboanga City. Travel time would be approximately 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours.</p><a href="https://www.airasia.com/flights/from-manila-mnl-to-zamboanga-zam">AIRASIATRAVELLINK</a><a href="https://www.cebupacificair.com/pages/explore/philippines/flights-to-Zamboanga">CEBUPACIFICLINK</a>
			<p><b class="travelcontent">By Boat:</b></p>
			<p>2Go Travel operates a weekly trip from Manila to Zamboanga. It takes place every Sunday at 10:00 p.m. If you are traveling from Zamboanga to Manila, the schedule is every Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. Travel time is approximately 45 hours. Please keep in mind that the service's ports are Manila Pier 4 and Zamboanga Port.</p><a href="https://12go.asia/en/ferry/manila/zamboanga">BOATLINKHERE</a>
			<p class="contentheader"> WHERE TO STAY IN ZAMBOANGA</p>
			<p>The majority of Zamboanga's hotels are concentrated in two key areas: the city core (closer to the seaport) and the airport area. Both have a plethora of dining and shopping options. Both have a wide range of low-cost options (although there are more expensive properties near the airport). Both are conveniently located and not too far apart. During rush hour, however, traffic in between can be a problem. As a result, which is preferable is determined by your itinerary.</p>
			<p>If you're in Zamboanga primarily to visit the Pink Beach or go on a day trip to Basilan, stay in the city center. However, if your intended destinations are mostly north of the city, such as Once Islas and Merloquet Falls, or if you don't want to risk missing your flight out, the area near the airport makes more sense. In any case, lodging in Zamboanga is significantly less expensive than in other highly urbanized cities in the Philippines. A double or twin room in a business hotel should cost between P1500-P1800 per night on average. However, you can find a room for less than PhP 1500, and even lower during ongoing promotions.</p><a href="https://bit.ly/3TxcHB1">Hotel Links</a>
			<p class="contentheader"> HOW TO GET AROUND ZAMBOANGA CITY </p>
			<p><b class="travelcontent">By Public Transportation</b></p>
			<p>The three most usual modes of transportation within the city are the jeepney, the tricycle, and the taxi. Tricycles, usually shortened to “tricy” in this part of Mindanao, are the most common. The ideal tricycle fare is P20 for the first kilometer and P5 for each additional kilometer. Taxis are another option, but they are less common. The flagdown rate is P40. Whatever mode of transportation you choose, keep rush hour in mind, especially if you're trying to catch a flight or a boat.</p>
			<p class="contentheader">THINGS TO DO IN ZAMBOANGA </p>
			<p><b class="travelcontent"> Pink Sands Beach (Grande Sta. Cruz Island)</b></p>
			<p> An island off the coast of Zamboanga Peninsula glows with a natural rosy blush when kissed by the sun. Pink Beach, named one of the World's 21 Best Beaches by National Geographic in 2017, is Zamboanga City's most popular tourist attraction. </p>
			<p> To manage your expectations, the pink color isn't particularly vivid or bright. From a distance, the sandy shore appears to be a typical white beach, but as you get closer, the pink taint becomes more apparent. The pale pink tint of the sand is caused by the weathering of red organ-pipe corals (tubipora musica) brought to the shore by the waves. The main access point to the island and its Pink Beach is Zamboanga City's Paseo del Mar, which runs along the southeastern side of the peninsula. From the city center, visitors can take a tricycle to the Santa Cruz Island Ferry Terminal in Paseo del Mar. The boat ride lasts approximately 20 minutes. </p>
			<p> Because the number of visitors is strictly limited, you must register in advance. Registration and boat service will begin at 7:00 a.m. Only day tours are permitted, and no overnight stays are permitted. The boat fee is P1000 for up to ten passengers. Even if your group is smaller, you must still pay the same amount. </p>
			<p><b class="travelcontent">Zamboanga City Tour</b></p>
			<p> Several historic and recreational sites dot the map of the city center and surrounding areas, providing a glimpse into the city's colorful past. You can visit these on your own by taking public transportation, but they are also popular stops on organized tours. </p>
			<ul class="listcontent">
				<li><span class="listcontentspan"><b>El Museo de Zamboanga</b> - Features two galleries reflecting the city's history and culture. </span></li>
				<li><span class="listcontentspan"><b>Pasonanca Park</b> - A magnificent large green place. </span></li>
				<li><span class="listcontentspan"><b>Scout Limbaga</b> - Camping, a convention center, an amphitheater, an aviary, a floral garden and butterfly sanctuary, and public swimming pools. </span></li>
				<li><span class="listcontentspan"><b>Climaco Freedom Park</b> - Named in honor of the late mayor of Zamboanga City, Cesar Climaco, a beloved local figure who was murdered in 1984.</span></li>

			</ul>
			<p class="contentheader">ZAMBOANGA FOOD TRIP</p>
			<p>Andi's Satti </p>
			<p>Satti is a popular breakfast option in Zamboanga City. Andi's Satti is one of the city's most well regarded satti-han restaurants. Other possibilities include Jimmy's Satti and other lesser-known satti restaurants.</p>
			<p>Curacha (Spanner Crabs) </p>
			<p>Curacha means cockroach in Chavacano, but don't get too excited because we're not asking you to go full Fear Factor. Instead, we'd like to invite you to sample one of Zamboanga's most delectable crustaceans: spanner crabs! (It gets its name from its spiky appearance.)</p>
			<p>So, what precisely is it? We're talking about Zamboanga's culinary jewel. Curacha resembles a cross between a giant crab and a hairy lobster. It is sought after because it is meatier and more flavorful than other crabs and has a consistent crimson hue whether raw or cooked. Fortunately, they thrive in the Sulu Sea's womb. Your journey will not be complete unless you try at least one dish. Alavar's Seafood Restaurant is well-known for its curacha dish prepared with its equally well-known speciality sauce. If you wish to bring some home, go to Aderes Flea Market in Guiwan, where you may get fresh, uncooked curacha for a lesser price. There are also lobsters available!</p>
			<p> Moro Cuisine </p>
			<p>Filipino Muslims, often known as Moros, are proud of their distinctive food. Although there are some similarities between Moro cuisine and other parts of the country in terms of seasonings and ingredients such as garlic, onions, and ginger, what distinguishes Moro cuisine are other spices such as turmeric, lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime — which are more commonly used by our ASEAN neighbors. Some dishes also include burnt or blackened coconut meat. </p>
			<p>Moro favorites include beef randang, piaparan, bakas, chicken pyanggang, pater, dodol, and lukatis. The latal is the greatest option if you want to try numerous dishes in one session. It is a platter of some of the region's native cuisine. Latal is available on the menus of both Bay Tal Mal (at SM Mindpro) and Dennis Coffee Garden (near the airport).</p>
			<p>Knickerbocker</p>
			<p>The knickerbocker is a variation on the popular Filipino dessert halo-halo. The distinction is that it is made of fresh fruits and is therefore healthier. It consists of banana, mango, apple, watermelon, gelatin, milk, and vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry ice cream on top. Some attribute its popularity to the Palmeras, a Zamboanga-based restaurant. It is now available at various stalls along Paseo del Mar.</p>
